## What is Contentful?

[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) provides content infrastructure for digital teams to power websites, apps, and
devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for
structured content, powerful management, and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enables developers and
content creators to ship their products faster.

$~$

## Getting started

To get started, read the following guidelines.

- [Environment variables](./README.md#environment-variables)
- [Dependencies](./README.md#dependencies)
- [Development](./README.md#development)
- [Contentful API & GraphQL](./README.md#contentful-api--graphql)
- [Contentful Components](./README.md#contentful-components)
- [Deployment](./README.md#deployment)

$~$

### Environment variables

In order to authenticate the requests to the Contentful APIs, the following values are necessary:

- Your space ID: [https://www.contentful.com/help/find-space-id/](https://www.contentful.com/help/find-space-id/)
- Contentful Delivery API
  token: [https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/)
- Contentful Preview API
  token: [https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-preview-api/](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-preview-api/)

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add the necessary values.

$~$

### Dependencies

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
yarn
```

### Run the Starter Template in development mode

```bash
yarn dev
```

The Starter Template should be up and running on `http://localhost:3000`.

All necessary dependencies are installed under `node_modules` and any necessary tools can be accessed via npm scripts.

$~$

## Development

### Node

It is recommended to use the Node version listed in the `.nvmrc` file, we recommend
using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to easily switch between Node versions.

$~$

### Husky & git hooks

This repository makes use of [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to enforce commit hooks.

The config for both the `pre-commit` and `pre-push` hooks can be found in the `.husky` folder, located in the root of
the project.

---

#### Pre-commit

Before allowing a commit, we require a successful result from the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) and our `lint-staged`
script will be run.

This ensures all ESLint and Prettier rules are enforced on the files that are staged to be committed.

The `tsc` command is run separately from the `lint-staged` step because we require the Typescript compiler to sample
_all_ files.

This is important to ensure that no deviating types were introduced by
the [codegen](./README.md#graphql--code-generation) for example.

---

#### Pre-push

The same two tasks are run for pre-push and for pre-commit.

---

#### Overriding the Husky git hooks

In case of wanting to bypass the `pre-commit` or `pre-push` hooks, pass a `--noVerify` flag to your Git commands.

⚠️ Make sure you only use this if you know why you're using it. ⚠️

$~$

### Contentful API & GraphQL

This project makes use of Contentful's [GraphQL API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/graphql/).

API calls made to the Contentful GraphQL endpoint are made through React Query `useQuery` hooks.

The hooks are generated from the `.graphql` files collocated within the components, the following happens:

1. `[folderName]/[fileName].graphql` file, containing a query, is detected by
   the [codegen](./README.md#graphql--code-generation)
2. `[folderName]/__generated/[fileName].generated.ts` is generated
3. Within the generated file, a new hook is generated with the following pattern: `use[fileName]`
4. The hook can now be imported and used within the `.ts(x)` files in the component folder

$~$

### GraphQL & code generation

We use `graphql-codegen` to generate a type-safe API client, utilizing [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/) as
the "client".

The data for the hooks is pre-fetched on the server-side.

For more information on how this data is hydrated please
read [the official documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/guides/ssr#using-hydration).

---

#### Commands

In order to (re-)generate the GraphQL schema, types and hooks, please use either of the following commands:

- `yarn graphql-codegen:generate` generates a schema, types and code to fetch data from the Contentful APIs
- `yarn graphql-codegen:watch` similar to the `generate` command, but it runs as a watch task which will rerun the steps
  when changes are made in the `.graphql` files

The first steps of the codegen generate files that contain the GraphQL schema and matching TypeScript types.
They're generated to the `src/lib/__generated` folder and ought to be committed once altered/added to the repository.

Additionally, the codegen watches .graphql files in our `src` folder, if it runs successfully it generates
a `__generated` folder collocated in the folder where the `.graphql` file was found.

One exception to this rule is the `src/lib/fragments` folder which contains shared GraphQL Fragments that are used in
several other queries/fragments.

The TS types for these files are generated in the same location, in a `__generated` folder and like the other files
ought to be committed.

---

#### Configuration

The configuration for the codegen can be found in `codegen.ts`, located in the root of the project.

$~$

### Contentful Components

The term _Contentful Components_ (_ctf-components_ for short) is used for React components that have an equivalent
Contentful _content type_.

E.g. all React components needed for rendering the _content-type_ `HeroBanner` can be found in the
folder `src/features/ctf-components/ctf-hero-banner`.

Usually a _ctf-component_ is composed of 3 files:

- `ctf-[contentypeName].graphql`: holding the query strings needed for the GraphQL request to fetch the components data.
- `ctf-[contentypeName]-gql.tsx`: React component which executes the GraphQL query and passes the result to a component
  for rendering.
- `ctf-[contentypeName].tsx`: the React component which is actually rendering the content type.

Optionally, a folder with TypeScript interfaces which were generated by GraphQL codegen can also be included:

- `/__generated/`: (see [GraphQL & code generation](./README.md#graphql--code-generation)).

$~$

### Component Resolver and content type mapping

There is a _component-resolver_ (_./src/components/component-resolver.tsx_) React component, which is used to pick the
right React component for rendering a _content-type_.

It requires as properties the _content type_ `id`, its `__typename`, `internalName` (used by XRAY-mode), and optionally
the content.

The **component-resolver** then uses a key map to find the right React component (`./src/mappings.ts`), where the key is
the _content type_ name and the value is the React component.

It will check the map `componentMap` first, and if the _content type_ could be resolved it is assumed all content is
available.
The content is then passed to the React component.

If the _content type_ could not be resolved, `componentGqlMap` will be used for resolving.
If the React component is found the _content type_ `id`, `__typename`, and `internalName` will be passed, which is used
by the component to fetch its data.

According to this pattern, all _ctf-components_ suffixed with `-gql` should be added to `componentGqlMap` and all
without a suffix should be added to `componentMap`.

$~$

### Creating new Contentful Components

Creating new _ctf-components_ involve the following steps:

- Create a folder for the component files (`./src/ctf-components/ctf-[contentTypeName]`)
- Create the file for the GraphQL query strings (`./src/ctf-components/ctf-[contentTypeName].graphql`)
- Optionally, generate TypeScript interfaces for the GraphQL result by calling `yarn graphql-codegen:generate` (
  see [GraphQL & code generation](./README.md#graphql--code-generation)).
- Create the React components for rendering (`./src/ctf-components/ctf-[contentTypeName]-gql.tsx`
  and `./src/ctf-components/ctf-[contentTypeName].tsx`).
- Add the component to the `componentGqlMap` in `./src/mappings.ts`.
